# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# üí° *Problem Statement*

The traditional insurance sector grapples with complexities in policy navigation, claim submissions, and data security, eroding trust for customers and operational efficiency for insurers. Legacy systems hinder collaboration and data sharing, while manual claims processing exacerbates inefficiencies, leading to increased costs and dissatisfaction. Blockchain technology offers transformative solutions, providing transparency, security, and automation. Smart contracts streamline policy issuance and claims settlement, reducing paperwork and operational burdens. Blockchain's decentralized architecture enhances security, mitigating data breach risks. By embracing blockchain, insurers can modernize processes, improve customer experiences, and gain a competitive edge, ensuring resilience and relevance in an increasingly digital landscape.

Insurers seek a platform with robust support that guarantees data security, bolstered by blockchain technology, instilling trust among users. This technology ensures data integrity, preventing leaks and breaches, thus enhancing user confidence. By providing a secure environment, insurers build credibility and foster strong relationships with customers, crucial for long-term success in the industry.
